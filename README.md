# kstring
A SSO-23 string loosely based on the standard. This is just a fun project, it is incomplet, and may have some bï¿½gs. This will not have all the functionality that the standard mandates, and may not exibit behavior exactly per standard. 

## Info
Size: 24 bytes (assuming `Elem = char`)
  
SSO Capacity: 23 chars

Speed: ~85% as fast as MSVC std::string
